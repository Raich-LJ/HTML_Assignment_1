       <h3>Where is this dish from?</h3>
        <p>The origin of fried noodles has been credited to the Chinese. The oldest mention of noodles was first found in
        the Chinaat, the Qijia culture Lajia site in Qinghai, Shandong province. It is possible that locals decided to
        dry or deep fry the prepared noodles to make them last longer but the actual innovator of the recipe is unknown.
        Different versions of this recipe gradually spread all over Asia and now each province or region of Asia will
        have its own recipe variations that include fry noodles.</p>

          <strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>(may or may not be correct)
          <li>Prepare the protein by slicing them against the grain into 1/4" / 0.5cm slices or 2/3" / 2cm cubes.</li>
          <li>Heat oil in wok over high heat. When oil is hot, add Base Flavouring of choice and stir fry for about 10
          seconds - don't let them burn!</li>
          <li>Add ingredients in order of length of time to cook, starting with those that take the longest but do not add
          leafy greens. Start with onion and proteins (together), followed by broccoli and other vegetables in "floret"
          form, followed by carrots, stems of leafy greens, zucchini, eggplant, beans and other firm vegetables, and
          lastly cabbage and snow peas and other vegetables that take little time to cook. DO NOT add bean sprouts or
          leafy greens - you will add them in the next step.</li>
          <li>Remove from heat, add leafy greens (leafy part of bok choy, spinach etc) and bean sprouts (if using), the
          noodles (use your fingers to break them up), the Sauce, water and Extra Flavours (optional).</li>
          <li>Return to heat, gently toss for 1 minute to heat through the noodles and for the sauce to thicken. If the
          water evaporates too quickly, add a bit more</li>
          <li>Serve immediately.</li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>

        <h3>Recipe Notes:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>My favourite is fresh hokkien noodles. But you can use any noodles for this dish, fried or fresh, except
          vermicelli (hard to stir fry with this sauce), or fresh soup egg noodles (the ones that come coated in
          cornflour in the packets. Because the cornflour (cornstarch) coating them makes the stir fry gluggy. The
          noodles that come coated in cornflour are for soups - the cornflour makes the soup slightly thicker.</li>
          <li>Dried rice noodles are suitable for "cooking" simply by pouring over plenty of boiling water and leaving
          them for 5 to 7 minutes. The dried egg noodles I use cannot be cooked in this way - but perhaps there are
          brands that this does work for that aren't available here in Australia.</li>
          <li>Cut vegetables to size so they will cook within a few minutes on high heat. When you are cooking the
          noodles, toss the vegetables into the wok in order of length of time to cook, starting with hard vegetables,
          like onion and carrots, and finishing with soft vegetables that do not take long to cook like snow peas and
          shredded Chinese Cabbagge.</li>
          <li>Always add leafy greens - like the tops of bok choy, pak choy, spinach - when you add the noodles. They will
          take less than a minute to wilt - any sooner and they will be way overcooked.</li>
          <li>Stir Fry Noodles Nutrition per serving assuming this is made with lean beef or chicken.</li>
